            :wave: @{issue-author}, sorry you're having an issue. As the issue template explains, it's required that you provide a runnable example that reproduces your issue (please read the [issue template](https://github.com/react-native-google-signin/google-signin/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/custom.yaml)).

            The reason is that the maintainer does not have time to try reproduce bugs himself. Please try to minimize the superfluous code and focus only on reproducing the bug.

            Please create a new issue with this and the maintainer will do his best to review it!.
